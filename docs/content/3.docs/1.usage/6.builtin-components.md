# Built-in Components

Nuxt comes with a few components included out of the box, which will be helpful when building your application. The components are globally available.

## General

### `<ClientOnly>`

This component is used to purposely render a component only on client-side. To import a component only on the client, register the component in a client-side only plugin.

```html{}[pages/example.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <Sidebar />
    <ClientOnly>
      <!-- this component will only be rendered on client-side -->
      <Comments />
    </ClientOnly>
  </div>
</template>
```

Use a slot as fallback until `<ClientOnly>` is mounted on client-side.

```html{}[pages/example.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <Sidebar />
    <ClientOnly>
      <!-- this component will only be rendered on client-side -->
      <Comments />
      <template #fallback>
        <!-- this will be rendered on server-side -->
        <p>Loading comments...</p>
      </template>
    </ClientOnly>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Router

The following components are available when you enables [Vue Router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/) via having the [`pages/` directory](/docs/directory-structure/pages) in your project (it's optional in Nuxt 3).

### `<NuxtLink>`

To navigate between pages of your app, you should use the  `<NuxtLink>` component. This component is included with Nuxt and therefore you don't have to import it like you do with other components. It is similar to the HTML `<a>` tag except that instead of using a `href="/about"` you use `to="/about"`. If you've used `vue-router` before, you can think of `<NuxtLink>` as a replacement of `<RouterLink>`

A simple link to the `index.vue` page in your `pages` folder:

```html
<template>
  <NuxtLink to="/">Home page</NuxtLink>
</template>
```

The `<NuxtLink>` component should be used for all internal links. That means for all links to the pages within your site you should use `<NuxtLink>`. The `<a>` tag should be used for all external links. That means if you have links to other websites you should use the `<a>` tag for those.

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Home page</h1>
    <NuxtLink to="/about">
      About (internal link that belongs to the Nuxt App)
    </NuxtLink>
    <a href="https://nuxtjs.org">External Link to another page</a>
  </div>
</template>
```

### `<NuxtPage>`

### `<NuxtChild>`

This component is used for displaying the children components in a nested route.

Example:

```
-| pages/
---| parent/
------| child.vue
---| parent.vue
```

This file tree will generate these routes:

```js
[
  {
    path: '/parent',
    component: '~/pages/parent.vue',
    name: 'parent',
    children: [
      {
        path: 'child',
        component: '~/pages/parent/child.vue',
        name: 'parent-child'
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

To display the `child.vue` component, you have to insert the `<NuxtChild>` component inside `pages/parent.vue`:

```html{}[pages/parent.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>I am the parent view</h1>
    <NuxtChild :foobar="123" />
  </div>
</template>
```

### `<NuxtLayout>`
